The Postman Public API Network is the largest network of APIs, workspaces, collections, and Flows by developers across the planet. Many of the teams and companies responsible for leading-edge APIs and technologies have public workspaces you can explore. Popular third-party APIs are also published, along with examples you can use as a starting point when writing your own APIs or collections.

To access the Public API Network, visit [postman.com/explore](https://www.postman.com/explore) or select **API Network > View all public APIs** in the header.

There are a variety of ways to find APIs, workspaces, teams, collections, and Flows:

* The **Search Postman** box at the top of the page searches all Postman teams, workspaces, collections, APIs, and Flows by default. You can also change the scope to **Public API Network** to limit your search to the Public API Network.
* **Spotlight** highlights the latest exciting, useful, and noteworthy contributions to the Public API Network, handpicked by the experts at Postman.
* **Trending APIs** shows elements that are the most popular in the Public API Network, based on the number of people viewing or creating forks of them.
* **Categories** showcases popular API categories in the Public API Network: [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.postman.com/category/artificial-intelligence), [Communication](https://www.postman.com/category/communication), [Data Analytics](https://www.postman.com/category/data-analytics), [Developer Productivity](https://www.postman.com/category/developer-productivity), [DevOps](https://www.postman.com/category/devops), [Financial Services](https://www.postman.com/category/financial-services), [Payments](https://www.postman.com/category/payments), and more.
* You can select to view **Collections**, **Workspaces**, and **Flows**. You can sort collection and workspace results by **Featured**, **New**, **Week**, and **All Time**. You can sort Flows results by **New**, **Most Viewed**, and **Most Forked**.
* You can also filter collections using the categories listed on its results page.

## About verified teams in the Public API Network

Verified teams in Postman have a verified badge next to their team name in the Public API Network. A verified badge means Postman has verified the team's identity as the authentic organization they represent, helping you discover authentic, useful, and trusted APIs.

The verified badge also displays next to a verified team's name in their [profile](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/) and [public workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/), and you can view the verified badge in your [Postman search results](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/#search-postman).

## Next steps

* To import a collection from a public workspace to your workspace, create a fork of it. See [creating a fork](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/#create-a-fork).

* To learn more about sharing APIs, workspaces, and collections to the Public API Network, see [Public API Network overview](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/).
