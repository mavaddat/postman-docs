_Postman Collections_ are a group of saved requests. Every request you send in Postman appears under the **History** tab of the sidebar. On a small scale, reusing requests through the history section is convenient. As your Postman usage grows, it can be time-consuming to find a particular request in your history. Instead of scrolling through your history section, you can save all your requests as a group for easier access.

## Create your first collection

To create a new collection, you can start by creating a new request first. You can create a new request from the sidebar in Postman.

To create a collection, do the following:

1. If you haven't already, [install the Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/get-postman/) and [sign in to Postman](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sign-in-to-postman/).
1. Select **New > HTTP**.

1. Enter a request in the request builder and select **Save**.
1. Create a new collection by selecting **New Collection**. Enter a collection name, and then select **Create**.

1. Select **Save** to save the request in the new collection.

After you save the request, your new collection and the request are listed under **Collections** in the sidebar.
