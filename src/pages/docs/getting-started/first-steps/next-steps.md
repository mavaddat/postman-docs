Now that you've sent a request, written a test, and can save requests to collections, check out some of the other things you can do in Postman:

* You can [run collections](/docs/collections/running-collections/running-collections-overview/) manually, or schedule collection runs to run regularly in the cloud. You can also automate collection runs in your CI/CD with the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) or [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/).
* [Postman Flows](/docs/postman-flows/gs/flows-overview/) is a visual tool for building API-driven applications for the API-first world. You can use Flows to chain requests, handle data, and create real-world workflows in your Postman workspace.
* Speaking of API-first, Postman supports API-first development with the [API Builder](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/the-api-workflow/). Use the API Builder to design your API in Postman. Your API definition can then act as the single source of truth for your API project.
* Documentation is an important part of any collection or API. You can [add documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/api-documentation-overview/) so users can understand what your collection or API does and how each request works. By default your documentation is private, but if you're creating a public API, you can publish your documentation to make it publicly available to anyone with a web browser.
* [Add your API to the Public API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/) to share your APIs with 20M+ users in the world’s largest public API network. Your API is searchable in the Postman app when it's available on the Public API Network.
