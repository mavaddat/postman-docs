This section covers the basic features of Postman that help you send API requests, share your work with others, and use Postman in your API development workflows. You'll also get a tour of the Postman user interface to launch you on your API-first journey.

## Find your way around Postman

Postman has a variety of tools you can use to work with APIs and collaborate with your team. [Learn how to navigate in Postman](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/) so you can always find the features you're looking for.

Need more help? Postbot is your AI assistant for API workflows. [You can ask Postbot](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postbot/) to add tests to requests, visualize responses, write documentation, and more.

## Send API requests from Postman

[The Postman Agent](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postman-agent/#selecting-a-postman-agent-for-requests) enables you to send API requests from a browser using the Postman web app. You can manually select an agent, or Postman can select the best agent for you.

If you're not signed in to a Postman account, you can still send multi-protocol requests using the [lightweight API client](/docs/getting-started/basics/using-api-client/).

> For the best experience sending API requests, [download the Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/get-postman/) and [sign in to your Postman account](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sign-in-to-postman/).

## Save and share your work in Postman

When you're signed in to your Postman account, all of your work is [automatically synced to the Postman cloud](/docs/getting-started/basics/syncing/). That means you can access all of your collections, requests, and other data anywhere you're signed in to Postman.

You can also share your work with members of your team using [Postman's collaboration tools](/docs/getting-started/basics/work-with-your-team/). Move your Postman data into a team workspace to begin collaborating with others.

## Use Postman in your development environment

With the [Postman VS Code extension](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-vs-code-extension/), you can use Postman in the same place where you develop your APIs. Send requests, work with Postman Collections, and import Postman data, all without leaving Visual Studio Code.
