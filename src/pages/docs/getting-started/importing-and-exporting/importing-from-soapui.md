SoapUI is an API testing tool that supports SOAP and REST services. Postman can import SoapUI project files and recreate their requests, collections, environments, and other data in your Postman workspace.

To find your local SoapUI project files, do the following:

1. In SoapUI, select a project.
1. Select **Project > Show Project View**.
1. In the Project View window, the project's file path appears in the **Project Summary** section.

## Import a SoapUI project to Postman

To import a SoapUI project into Postman, do the following:

1. In Postman, select **Import > Migrate to Postman > SoapUI**.
1. Select **files** or **folder**, then select the files or folder you want to import.
1. Select **Open**. Postman checks if the selected files are valid SoapUI projects.
