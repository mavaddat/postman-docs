* Social media links like your GitHub profile
* Links to any teams you are a part of
* An **About Me** section
* A **Highlights** section with pinned elements
* An **Activity** feed with a chronological list of your public activities
* All the public APIs, collections, and workspaces you've created, across all your teams
