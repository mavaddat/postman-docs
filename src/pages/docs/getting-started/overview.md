Welcome! This section of the Learning Center contains topics about how to get started using Postman.

To get up and running with Postman, check out [Postman first steps](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/overview/). You'll learn how to use Postman to send requests, write tests, collaborate with your team, and more.

You can also jump to one of the following topics to learn more about Postman:

* To get started sending requests and more in Postman, download and install the [Postman desktop app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). To learn more, see [Installing and updating Postman](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/).

* Once you're in Postman, check out how to [navigate Postman](/docs/getting-started/basics/navigating-postman/). After you're familiar with the interface, try [sending your first request](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/sending-the-first-request/).

* Create a Postman account. Then, learn more about [managing your account](/docs/getting-started/installation/postman-account/), [customizing your Postman profile](/docs/getting-started/installation/postman-profile/), and [setting up Postman](/docs/getting-started/installation/settings/).

* A great place to find APIs is the Postman Public API Network. Learn more on how to use it at [explore the Public API Network](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/exploring-public-api-network/).

* After you've created a few requests, you'll want to organize them into collections and workspaces. Check out [create your first collection](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/creating-the-first-collection/) and [create a workspace](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/creating-your-first-workspace/).

* You can also import requests and other data into Postman, and export it for use with other programs. Check out [importing and exporting data](/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-and-exporting-overview/).

* Having trouble? Learn how to [troubleshoot app issues](/docs/introduction/troubleshooting-inapp/).
