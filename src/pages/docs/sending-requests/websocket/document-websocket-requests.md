Postman automatically generates documentation for each of your requests. The documentation includes the request’s URL, parameters, settings, and any saved messages. You can also add a description to help users understand how to use the request.

To view and edit documentation for a WebSocket request, do the following:

1. Open the request.
1. Select the documentation icon <img alt="Documentation icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-icon-v8-10.jpg#icon" width="16px"> in the right sidebar.
1. Select **Add description**.
    > You can also select **Generate with Postbot** to use [Postman's AI assistant](/docs/getting-started/basics/about-postbot/) to document your WebSocket request.
1. Write your content using Postman’s [built-in editing tools](/docs/publishing-your-api/authoring-your-documentation/). Your documentation automatically saves. If you need to make changes, you can edit the description.

> You can also add a description to your collection’s overview or a folder in your collection. Select the collection or folder in the sidebar, then select **Add collection description** or **Add folder description**.
