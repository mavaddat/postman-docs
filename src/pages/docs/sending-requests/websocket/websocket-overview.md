Postman supports the WebSocket protocol. The WebSocket protocol provides a way to exchange data between a client and a server over a persistent connection. The data can be passed in both directions with low latency and overhead, and without breaking the connection.

WebSockets offers a bidirectional, full-duplex communications channel that operates over HTTP through a single TCP socket connection. This means the server can independently send data to the client without the client having to request it, and vice versa.

In Postman, you can create a WebSocket request with a server, and use it to send and receive messages across the WebSocket connection. If you haven't already, [download and install the Postman desktop app](/docs/getting-started/installation/installation-and-updates/) to get started.
