In Socket.IO, you have the ability to listen to specific events. The **Response** pane displays the received events for which youâ€™ve added listeners. Events are color coded by event to make them easier to find.

To listen to a new event, do the following:

1. Select the **Events** tab.
1. Select **+** or **Add event**.
1. Enter a name and description for the event.
1. Select the **Listen** switch next to an event to turn listening on or off for that event.
    > To delete the event listener, hover over the **Listen** switch and select the delete icon <img alt="Delete icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icons/icon-delete-red-v10-19.jpg#icon" width="14px">.
