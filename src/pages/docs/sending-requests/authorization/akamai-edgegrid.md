Akamai EdgeGrid is an authorization helper developed and used by Akamai.

To use Akamai EdgeGrid, do the following:

1. In the __Authorization__ tab for a request, select __Akamai EdgeGrid__ from the __Type__ dropdown list.

1. Enter your __Access Token__, __Client Token__, and __Client Secret__, using variables for extra securityâ€”you will receive these details when you register a client application with Akamai.

> When the required details are complete in the __Authorization__ tab for your request, Postman will add them to the __Headers__.

For information on obtaining your credentials, see [Akamai Developer - Authorize your Client](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/set-up-authentication-credentials).
