Hawk authentication enables you to authorize requests using partial cryptographic verification.

To use Hawk authentication, do the following:

1. In the __Authorization__ tab for a request, select __Hawk Authentication__ from the __Type__ dropdown list.

1. Enter your details in the __Hawk Auth ID__, __Hawk Auth Key__, and __Algorithm__ fields. You can optionally set advanced details, but Postman will try to generate values for them if necessary.

> When the required details are complete in the __Authorization__ tab for your request, Postman will add them to the __Headers__.

The Hawk Authentication parameters are as follows:

* **Hawk Auth ID** - Your API authentication ID value.
* **Hawk Auth Key** - Your API authentication key value.
* **Algorithm** - The hash algorithm used to create the message authentication code (MAC).
* Advanced parameters:
    * **User** - The username.
    * **Nonce** - A random string generated by the client.
    * **ext** - Any application-specific information to be sent with the request.
    * **app** - The binding between credentials and the application to prevent an attacker using credentials issued to someone else.
    * **dlg** - The ID of the application the credentials were issued to.
    * **Timestamp** - Timestamp the server uses to prevent replay attacks outside the time window.
