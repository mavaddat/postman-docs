A _Postman Collection_ is a set of API endpoints or requests, along with each endpoint's authorization type, parameters, headers, request bodies, tests, and settings grouped under the same collection ID.

A collection enables you to group requests with different method types (for example `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, and `PUT`) and organize them into folders or subfolders. You can share collections with team members, as well as import and export them into other Postman instances.

Postman Collections are based on the open source _collection format_ that makes it possible to share and run collections. The collection format is:

* Portable and provides a unique interface for organizing API requests and modeling API workflows.
* Machine and human readable and can be used to generate client and server-side SDKs, documentation, and mock servers.

## Get started using collections

To learn more about the collection format, see the [Postman Collection Format documentation](https://learning.postman.com/collection-format/).

If you're getting started with collections for the first time, learn how to [Create your first collection](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/creating-the-first-collection/).

After you've created collections, you can learn more about how to manage and use them in [Create and manage request collections in Postman](/docs/collections/using-collections/).

You'll also learn how the _Collection Runner_ enables you to run a collection's requests in a specified sequence. You can run collections manually, on a schedule, from a monitor, from a webhook, or in your CI/CD pipeline by running it from the command line. See [Test your API functionality](/docs/collections/running-collections/running-collections-overview/) for more information.
