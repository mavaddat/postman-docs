You can import your existing OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 definitions ([OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html)) into Postman. Postman supports both YAML and JSON formats.

To import an API definition into Postman, select **Import** in the sidebar. You can choose to upload a file or folder, enter a URL, or paste your raw JSON or YAML. You can also import from a code repository, an API gateway, or an API client. Learn more about [importing an API into Postman](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/).

After importing your API into Postman, you can [edit your API definition](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/developing-an-api/defining-an-api/), [validate your definition](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/developing-an-api/validating-elements-against-schema/), or [generate a collection](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/developing-an-api/adding-api-elements/#generating-a-collection) or [generate server code](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/developing-an-api/generating-server-code/) based on your definition. You can also [connect your API to a Git repository](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/versioning-an-api-overview/) to collaborate with others.
