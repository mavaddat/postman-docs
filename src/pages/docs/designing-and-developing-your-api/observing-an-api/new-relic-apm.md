New Relic is an application performance management (APM) solution to monitor real-time and trending data for your processes or web apps. The API Builder has a New Relic integration that enables you to access New Relic APM metrics from within Postman.

With this integration, you can link your API in Postman to multiple services from New Relic. Each New Relic service corresponds to an API instance, such as `beta`, `prod1`, or `prod2`. You can also link multiple dashboards from New Relic to your API in Postman.

> **Want to send Postman monitor results to New Relic?** Sending monitor results to New Relic is a separate integration from viewing APM metrics in Postman and uses a different New Relic API key. The integration in the API Builder has two tabs that cover both integrations. Learn more about [configuring a Postman monitor integration with New Relic](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/new-relic/).

## Connecting to New Relic APM

Before you begin, you must set up APM services for each deployment of your API. See the [New Relic APM documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/) for more details.

To connect an API to New Relic APM, do the following:

1. Select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API.
1. Select **API Performance**.
1. Under **Connect Postman to your monitoring workflows**, select **New Relic**.
1. Enter your **New Relic API Key** (User Key).

    > There are multiple types of API keys in New Relic. Make sure to use a **User Key** for connecting an API to New Relic. To learn more, see the [New Relic API keys documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/).

1. Select one or more New Relic **Services** to connect to Postman.
1. (Optional) Select one or more New Relic **Dashboards** to view in Postman.
1. Select your New Relic region (**US** or **EU**).
1. Select **Connect**.
1. If you want, you can also configure an integration to send your Postman monitor run results to New Relic. Enter details for the integration, or select **Maybe Later**. Learn more about [configuring a Postman monitor integration with New Relic](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/new-relic/).

## Viewing New Relic APM metrics

After connecting to New Relic APM, you can view metrics for your New Relic services in Postman. Select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API. Select **API Performance**.

For each New Relic service, you can view the latency, error rate, and apdex (application performance index). You can also view the service's health status, for example `Healthy`, `Warning`, and `Critical`. Health status is based on violations of alert conditions in New Relic. To learn more, see the New Relic documentation for [viewing alert violations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-violations/view-alert-violations-our-products/).

If you linked dashboards when connecting to New Relic, you can view them by selecting **Dashboard Quicklinks** and selecting a dashboard.

Select the name of a New Relic service to view APM graphs for that service. The graphs display metrics for web transaction time, throughput, error rate, and apdex score. Hover over a data point on a graph to view more details. The tables below the graphs list violation events, slowest transactions by time, and deployments.

From here you can take the following actions:

* To view graphs for a different service, select the service in the dropdown list.
* To view the service in New Relic, select **View on New Relic**.
* To view metrics for a different time range, select the time range in the dropdown list.
* To view the latest metrics, select <img alt="Refresh icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-refresh-v9-5.jpg#icon" width="14px"> **Refresh**.
* To edit or delete the integration, select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> .
