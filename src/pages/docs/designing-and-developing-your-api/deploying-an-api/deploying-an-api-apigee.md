[Apigee X](https://cloud.google.com/apigee) enables developers to manage access to their APIs by abstracting services behind a secure proxy layer. Once connected to Apigee X, you can view your API deployment status and history from within Postman.

> Postman supports connecting to organizations and proxies hosted in Apigee X. Postman doesn't support connecting to Apigee Edge.

## Creating a service account and private key

When setting up the connection to Apigee, you need to enter a service account email and a private key. You can create the required items in your Google Cloud project. Follow the steps below to [add a custom role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles), [create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts), and [generate a private key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).

To create a custom role, do the following:

1. Log on to the [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard) and go to your project settings.
1. Select **Roles** in the left navigation pane, and then select **+ Create Role**.
1. Enter the required details for the role, and then select **+ Add permissions**.
1. Select the checkbox next to the following permission properties (enter a property name to locate it in the list):

    * `apigee.deployments.list`
    * `apigee.environments.list`
    * `apigee.environments.get`
    * `apigee.organizations.list`
    * `apigee.organizations.get`
    * `apigee.proxies.list`
    * `apigee.proxies.get`
    * `apigee.proxyrevisions.get`

1. Select **Add** and verify that you added the correct permissions to the role.
1. Select **Create** to finish creating the custom role.

To create a service account, do the following:

1. Select **Service Accounts** in the left navigation pane.
1. Select **+ Create Service Account**.
1. Enter the required details for the service account and select **Create and Continue**.
1. In the **Role** drop-down list, select the custom role you created (enter the custom role name to locate it in the list).

    > Postman recommends adding a custom role to the service account. If you can't add a custom role, you can instead add the `Apigee API Reader` role and the `Apigee Environment Admin` role to the service account.

1. Select **Done** to finish creating the service account.

To generate a private key, do the following:

1. Select the new service account to open it and select the **Keys** tab.
1. Select **Add key** and select **Create new key**.
1. Select the **JSON** key type and select **Create**.

<img alt="Generating a private key" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/apigee-create-key-v9-13.jpg" width="564px"/>

Your browser will automatically download a JSON file that has values for `client_email` and a `private_key`. You will use these values when connecting Postman to Apigee X.

## Connecting to Apigee X

To connect to Apigee X in Postman, select **APIs** in the sidebar and select an API. Select **Deployments**, and then select **Apigee X**.

To authenticate with Apigee X, do the following:

1. Enter the **Service Account Email** and **Private Key**. You can find the values in the JSON file you downloaded.

    > Instead of manually entering the keys, you can upload the JSON file that has your service account email and private key. The values will be automatically populated.

1. Select **Connect**.

To set up the connection to Apigee X, do the following:

1. Select the **Organization** that has the proxy you want to connect to Postman.
1. Enter a **Nickname** for this integration.
1. Select the **API Proxy** that you want to connect to your API in Postman.
1. Select one or more **Environments** where you deploy your API in Apigee X.
