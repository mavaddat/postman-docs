You can use a variety of Postman developer resources in your projects, including APIs and libraries. You can use and contribute to Postman's [open-source](https://www.postman.com/open-philosophy/) projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/postmanlabs).

Check out the pages in this section for an intro to developer resources that enable you to engage with the Postman community and integrate Postman into your workflow.

* [Postman API](/docs/developer/postman-api/intro-api/)
    * Make requests to access your Postman data.
* [Echo API](/docs/developer/echo-api/)
    * Use the Echo API to learn and experiment with Postman.
* [Postman Collection Format documentation](https://learning.postman.com/collection-format/)
    * The Collection Format is the specification that drives collections in Postman. It's portable and provides a unique interface for organizing API requests and modeling API workflows. It's machine and human-readable and can be used to generate client and server-side SDKs, documentation, and mock servers. Learn more at the Postman Collection Format documentation.
* [Postman Collection SDK](/docs/developer/collection-sdk/)
    * The Postman Collection SDK is a JavaScript module for working with Postman [collections](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/intro-to-collections/).
* [Runtime library](/docs/developer/runtime-library/)
    * The Runtime library powers Postman request sending functionality.
* [Code generators](/docs/developer/code-generators/)
    * Postman uses the code generators SDK to create client snippets from your requests.
* [Postman Collection converters](/docs/developer/collection-conversion/)
    * The converters allow you to transform OpenAPI, Swagger, RAML, and GraphQL specs to Postman Collection format.
