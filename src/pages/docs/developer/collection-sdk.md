The Collection SDK is a Node.js module that allows you to work with Postman [Collections](/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/intro-to-collections/) and build them dynamically into your API project pipeline.

With the Collection SDK, you can create and manipulate collections, exporting them in a format that you can then integrate with other utilities, including Postman and [Newman](/docs/collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/), Postman's command-line collection runner.

## Accessing the Collection SDK

The Collection SDK is an open-source project. [Visit the repo](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-collection) for more detail on using the module in your own projects. The [SDK documentation](http://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/) provides an overview of the available objects and methods within the SDK, as well as an intro to the related [concepts](http://www.postmanlabs.com/postman-collection/tutorial-concepts.html).

You can install the SDK from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postman-collection) or directly from the repo. The following excerpt demonstrates using the SDK to read a file and parse it into a collection object in JavaScript:

```js
var fs = require('fs'),
  Collection = require('postman-collection').Collection,
  myCollection;

myCollection = new Collection(JSON.parse
  (fs.readFileSync('sample-collection.json').toString()));

console.log(myCollection.toJSON());
```

The Collection SDK provides an interface for working with the data structures defined by the [Postman Collection Schema](https://schema.postman.com/). You can use the SDK methods to create and manipulate collection elements, define request detail, variables, authentication, and so on.

Get started with the Collection SDK from the [project repo](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-collection), installing it and using the methods to build collections in a way that suits your development or testing project. You can also fork and contribute to the project, or create issues for any problems or feature requests.

## Next steps

If you're working with the Collection SDK to automate part of your collection run workflow, you can integrate your Collection SDK development with Newman, Postman's command-line collection runner:
