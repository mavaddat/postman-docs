Postman has a variety of features that enable you to [collaborate with your team and API consumers](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-collaboration/). You can change your workspace visibility, assign roles to collaborators, share your workspaces, and use Postman's API version control. With these features, you can tailor your collaboration strategy to each project's specific goals.

## Collaborate with your team

[Collaborate with team members](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaboration-overview/) by creating and joining team workspaces and discussing your work with comments. You can improve your team's onboarding experience with team discovery, enabling users in your organization to request to join your Postman team.

## Organize your projects using workspaces

You can [organize your projects using workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/), enabling you to collaborate with teammates or anyone in the Postman community. Use the visibility setting for a workspace to determine who can access it. When you create a workspace, you can choose an empty workspace to start from scratch, or a workspace template to help you get started. You can also view changelogs for collections, workspaces, and APIs, enabling you to review actions taken on elements in your workspaces.

## Define roles and permissions

You can define the [roles and permissions](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/) assigned to team members at the team, workspace, and element levels. You can also define roles and permissions that relate to Partner Workspaces and the Private API Network.

You can [organize team members into groups](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/user-groups/) that reflect your organization. This enables you to add users to a group, then assign that group roles and access to the resources they'll be using across Postman. This also enables you to efficiently onboard new team members by adding them to existing groups assigned relevant roles.

You can also [manage access to workspaces and elements](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/requesting-access-to-elements/) in your team. Depending on your assigned roles, you can:

* Manage the workspace and element-based roles assigned to team members.
* Request the Editor role in workspaces and elements.
* Approve requests to access workspaces and elements.

## Share your workspaces and elements

You can share your workspaces and elements with specific team members and users who are external to your team. You can also share with internal team members to the Private API Network, and share with your API's consumers to the Public API Network.

You can share your workspaces and elements in the following ways:

* **Share your work** - You can [share elements](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/sharing/) with team members, groups, and external users. You can share with users by name, email address, or group name. You can also copy an element's name to your clipboard, and share the URL with the user directly. Super Admins and Community Managers can use the [Manage public elements dashboard](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/manage-public-elements/) ([Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)) to control which public workspaces, documentation, and collections are shared with external users.
* **The Private API Network** ([Enterprise plans only](https://www.postman.com/pricing)) - You can share your team's APIs internally to [the Postman Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/adding-private-network/). This enables your Postman team to access workspaces, collections, and APIs that your team uses internally. You can also use the Postman API to programmatically manage elements shared to your team's Private API Network.
* **The Public API Network** - You can share your public APIs externally to [the Postman Public API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-api-network/public-api-network-overview/). This enables your API's consumers to access your public workspaces, collections, APIs, and Flows. Share your APIs to the Public API Network to improve your API's onboarding experience, increase your API's discovery, collect feedback from your API's consumers, and more.

## Build APIs using Postman's version control

You can [use Postman's version control](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/version-control-overview/) to collaboratively build APIs with your team. This enables you and your team to fork a new instance of an element, make updates to the fork, create a pull request, and merge your changes into the parent element.
