Add elements to the Private API Network to help your team discover and use your team's workspaces, collections, and APIs. You can organize related elements into folders.

[Super Admins](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) and [API Network Managers](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#network-roles) can manage all folders and elements in your Private API Network. You can assign team members the [Folder Manager role](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#network-roles) at the folder level, giving them permission to manage specific folders and the elements in them.

## Adding elements

API Network Managers can add elements to the Private API Network. Folder Managers can add elements to folders they have permission to manage. Workspace Editors, Collection Editors, and API Editors must [request to add elements to the Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/private-network-requests/#requesting-to-add-elements).

To add an element to the Private API Network, it must be in a team or public workspace. You can't add an element to the Private API Network unless all team members have at least view access to the element. Learn more about team [roles and permissions](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/).

The collections and APIs you add to the Private API Network include the latest changes to these elements.

> When you add a workspace, collection, or API to the [Private API Network](https://go.postman.co/network/private), it's visible to your Postman team, but isn't visible to [partners](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/).

<!-- -->

> You can add elements to the Private API Network from the workbench and with the [Postman API](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/publish-private-network-elements-with-api/).

### Adding elements in your Private API Network

You can add elements from inside your team's Private API Network. Workspace Editors, Collection Editors, and API Editors can [request to add elements from your Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/private-network-requests/#requesting-to-add-elements-in-your-private-api-network).

To add elements from your Private API Network, do the following:

1. Open your [Private API Network](https://go.postman.co/network/private).
1. Select the **+** icon in the left sidebar to add elements to the root Home folder.

Learn more about adding tags to [collections](/docs/collections/using-collections/#tagging-a-collection), [APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/managing-apis/#tagging-apis), and [workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/managing-workspaces/#tagging-a-workspace).

    If you're adding collections and APIs, you can optionally select environments in their workspace to make sure users have access to environment variables. You can also [edit a collection's or APIâ€™s environments later](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/managing-private-network/#editing-collections).

    > Not selecting an environment results in a different behavior between collections and APIs. In the case of collections, _No Environment_ is available in the Private Network. But, if _No Environment_ is selected while adding an API, all environments from the same workspace in which the API resides are available.

    You can select **Added elements** in the upper-right corner to show elements already added to the Private API Network. You can select the **Collections** tab and then **Forks** in the upper-right corner to show [forked collections](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-elements/).

    > An API's editor must [publish a version of the API](#publishing-specific-api-versions) before you can add it to your Private API Network.

    <!-- -->

    > You can select an element's name to open it in its workspace in a new tab.

#### Publishing specific API versions

Publishing a version creates a static representation of your API that consumers can view on the Private API Network. If your API is connected to a Git repository, you need to publish an API version to update your team or public workspace with the latest changes. When you publish a version, the API's definition and collections are synced to the Postman cloud.

> If you publish an API with an API definition that has syntax errors, your API documentation might not display as expected. To learn more about viewing syntax errors, see [Viewing syntax errors in your API definition](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/developing-an-api/validating-elements-against-schema/#viewing-syntax-errors-in-your-api-definition).

Learn more about [publishing an API version](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/api-versions/).

#### Importing APIs from a code repository

You can make all your existing APIs discoverable on the Private API Network after you import them from a code repository. Learn more about [importing an API](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/importing-an-api/).

## Reviewing requests to add elements

API Network Managers can review requests to add elements to the Private API Network. Folder Managers can review requests to add elements to folders they have permission to manage.

When an Editor requests to add an element to your team's Private API Network, Postman will send you an email and an in-app notification. For the list of all the pending requests, open the [Private API Network](https://go.postman.co/network/private) and select the pending requests icon <img alt="Pending requests icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/icon-pending-request-v10.jpg#icon" width="22px"> in the left sidebar.

Pending requests include the element type, the user who submitted the request, the date they submitted it on, a link to view the element in its workspace, the folder they want to add the element to, and an optional note from the requesting user. If the element is an API, pending requests also include syntax errors and rule violations if they're present in the API definition.

<img alt="Approve or deny a request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/private-api-network-pending-requests-v10-3.jpg"/>

You can also select the request to preview the element in the network before you approve or deny it.
