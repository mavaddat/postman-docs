When a Flow is just a few blocks, it's easy for its creator to understand. Once Flows become more than a few blocks and other users start working on them, it can become difficult to understand what all the moving parts are doing. That's where tools like colors, annotations, and grouping comes in.

### Colors

You can configure every block to be highlighted with a color. This can make it easy to differentiate two of the same types of block that are doing different things right next to each other. You can add a color by selecting a block, then selecting the paint icon in the top-left corner that appears on the block.

### Annotations

When collaborating with other people or putting a Flow in a public workspace, it's helpful to add directions directly on the canvas. This helps explain how to use the Flow and what certain blocks are doing. Select the **Add Text** button in the toolbar to add an annotation. Selecting text in an annotation opens the text formatting menu which has bold, italics, and heading options. If you copy a link, then highlight some text and paste the link, the highlighted text becomes a hyperlink.

### Grouping

Grouping enables any number of blocks and annotations to be grouped together. The group can then be named, given a color, resized, and have blocks added or removed from it. This can be useful when several blocks may be involved in performing a task such as sending an email.

You can access the grouping menu by either holding the Shift key and dragging the cursor around a set of blocks, or by pressing and holding **âŒ˜** or **Ctrl** then selecting the blocks you want to add. Selecting the file icon will create a group.
