## The Postman Flows user interface

* [Navigation](#navigation)

### Blocks on the canvas

The following blocks can be used to construct your application:

* **(1) The Start block:** The first block found in every Flow and the only one that can't be deleted. Application forms and webhooks send their information through this block.
* **(2) Other blocks:** One of the many types of other blocks that can be used in a Flow. The list of blocks is [here](/docs/postman-flows/reference/blocks-list/).
* **(3) Groups:** Enables organization, documentation, and building of Flows since groups can be duplicated. More information on organizing a Flow can be found [here](/docs/postman-flows/concepts/organizing-a-flow/).
* **(4) Text annotations:** One of the ways to document a Flow for other users or explain complex tasks being performed.

### Building applications

The following controls are used to build your application:

* **(5) Webhook:** Create a Flow that either runs automatically on a schedule, or whenever a specified event happens. More information on webhooks and automatic runs can be found [here](/docs/postman-flows/concepts/automatic-runs/).
* **(7) Console:** This is where you can find all API activity. This is useful for debugging Flows and ensuring your Flow is running with the expected information. A guide on debugging Flows can be found [here](/docs/postman-flows/reference/debugging/).

### Navigation

Navigate the canvas with the following controls:

* **(8) Toolbar**: Contains the Redo/Undo, Zoom, and Fit view buttons.
* **(9) Run:** Runs the Flow.
* **(10) Add annotation:** Adds a text annotation.
* **(11) Minimap:** Enables easier navigation of larger Flows.
