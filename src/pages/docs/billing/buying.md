Visit the [pricing page](https://www.postman.com/pricing) to purchase a Postman Basic, Professional, or Enterprise plan. Select __Buy Now__ for your chosen plan. If you are [upgrading from an existing paid account](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes), you can use the links in your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing).

## Configuring your plan

During the buying process you will be prompted to supply the following details:

* Your billing cycle (monthly or annual).
* How many paid user seats you need (you'll need a paid seat for anyone who needs to access the relevant Postman features, but each team has two free seats you can use for account management or billing).
* Your account email and [role](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) (Admin if you're going to be using the paid Postman plan yourself, or Billing if you are only making the purchase).
    * If you choose the Billing role you can also enter an admin email address, which is where your account activation email will be sent so that the administrator can get your Postman plan set up.

Once your plan configuration is in place you can enter your payment details. __Your saved payment method will automatically be charged monthly or annually, depending on your billing cycle. Additional charges for your account, such as monitoring overages, will also be made to your saved payment method.__

* For security reasons, Postman doesn't store any payment method data. The data is stored only by payment provider Stripe, who are certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1.
* Review the details of your plan to ensure they're correct before you submit your payment details.
* After payment, you'll receive a confirmation with the transaction ID. Use this ID for any communication with Postman.
* The assigned Admin will receive an activation link where you can begin inviting users. Billing-only users will receive a link to join the team in the Billing role.

## Next steps

After you have selected and purchased a paid plan, you can manage your billing, customize your team's experience, and collaborate with your team:

* You can manage your account in your [billing dashboard](http://go.postman.co/billing). For example, you could [change or upgrade](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes) your plan.
