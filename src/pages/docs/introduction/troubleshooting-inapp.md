## Accessing the DevTools console

The DevTools console provides internal debugging entries for Postman that may be useful in troubleshooting problems with the app.

To access the DevTools console logs, go to **View > Developer > Show DevTools (Current View)**. In the DevTools window, select __Console__ to access the app debug logs.

## Checking Postman's status

Wondering if Postman is experiencing issues? Check the [Postman Status page](https://status.postman.com/), which lets you know if Postman is experiencing degraded performance, outages, or is undergoing maintenance.

## Hardware acceleration

Postman takes advantage of your computer's built-in graphics hardware to speed up the rendering of onscreen graphics. Sometimes your computer's specific GPU, drivers, or operating system may cause issues with hardware acceleration. If you see screen artifacts or other glitches, turning off hardware acceleration might solve the problem.

To activate or deactivate hardware acceleration in Postman:

* On macOS, select **Postman > Hardware Acceleration**.
* On Windows or Linux, select **Help > Hardware Acceleration**.

Restart Postman to apply the new setting. Disabling hardware acceleration may affect performance or CPU usage.
