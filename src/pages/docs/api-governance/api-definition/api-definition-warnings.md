Postman supports API governance and API security rules for API definitions in [OpenAPI 3.1](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/openapi3/), [OpenAPI 3.0](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/openapi3/), and [OpenAPI 2.0](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/openapi2/) format.

> **Rule customization**. [Enterprise teams](https://www.postman.com/pricing/) can also customize the rules that Postman applies to API definitions. For more information, see [Configuring API governance rules](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/) and [Configuring API security rules](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-security-rules/).

To check the governance and security rule violations in the API definition:

1. Select **APIs** in the sidebar, and then select the API you want to review.
1. From the API overview page, in the **Definition** section, select **View files**.

    > You can also select **APIs** in the sidebar, then select the API definition file directly.

1. Select **Rule** to see the list of rule violations.

To learn more about how rule violations can help you create consistent and secure API definitions, see [Viewing rule violations in your API definition](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/developing-an-api/validating-elements-against-schema/#viewing-rule-violations-in-your-api-definition).

## Tracking governance and security rule violations in CI/CD

> [This feature is available on Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)

You can configure your CI/CD pipelines to enforce the [API Governance](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-governance-rules/) and [API Security](/docs/api-governance/configurable-rules/configuring-api-security-rules/) rules configured for your team with the help of the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/).

On the Postman CLI configuration page, select **Run Governance and Security rules**. This will generate the Postman CLI configuration. You can use this in your CI/CD configuration to enforce your API Governance and API Security rules each time the CI/CD pipeline runs.

To see the results, go to the build run page and use the arrows to expand the desired build. Next, expand the API definition to see the buildâ€™s results and any rule violations, if applicable.

## Next steps

For the list of all the rule violations that Postman might show at the API definition phase of development, see [OpenAPI 3 rules](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/openapi3/) and [OpenAPI 2 rules](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/openapi2/).
