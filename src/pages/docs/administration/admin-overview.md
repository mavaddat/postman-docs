Postman has a variety of tools you can use to set up, manage, and secure your Postman team. Whether you're setting up a new team or managing an existing one, you can customize your team's experience to align with your organization's goals.

You must be a [Team Admin or Super Admin](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) to set up, manage, and secure your Postman team.

To set up a new Postman team, you can follow the steps in Postman's [onboarding checklist](/docs/administration/onboarding-checklist/).

## Set up and manage your Postman team

You can [invite and manage collaborators](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-members/) in your Postman team, and update their assigned roles. You can also [adjust your team's Postman plan](/docs/billing/billing/#team-and-plan-changes) as needed.

You can [configure your team settings](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/) to further customize the experience for both your Postman team and your API's consumers. This includes managing your team's public profile and making your team discoverable.

If you're setting up an [Enterprise team](https://www.postman.com/pricing), more features are available to you with [Postman Enterprise plans](/docs/administration/enterprise/about-postman-enterprise/). Enterprise features include advanced identity management, reports, a Private API Network, API governance and security controls, and features that enhance collaboration and administration customization.
