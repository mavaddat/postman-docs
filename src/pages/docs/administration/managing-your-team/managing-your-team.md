Postman provides a variety of tools you can use to set up, manage, and secure your team. As a [Team Admin or Super Admin](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles), you can streamline the onboarding process, manage access to workspaces and products, and customize your team's experience to align with your organization's goals.

> If you're setting up your Postman team, check out Postman's [onboarding checklist](/docs/administration/onboarding-checklist/) to get started.

## Contents

* [Manage team members](#manage-team-members)
* [Manage team workspaces](#manage-team-workspaces)
* [Manage product access](#manage-product-access)
* [Configure team settings](#configure-team-settings)
* [Secure your Postman team](#secure-your-postman-team)

## Manage team members

You can [invite collaborators](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-members/#invite-users) to your Postman team, including Developers, Admins, external partners, and Guests. You can [update users' assigned roles](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-members/#manage-team-roles) and manage their access to resources as needed.

If you're setting up an [Enterprise team](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you can use [Postman groups](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/user-groups/) to assign roles and manage access to elements at scale.

## Manage team workspaces

[Team workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/) enable you to share projects with collaborators and manage access to them within your team.

If you're setting up a [Professional or Enterprise team](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you can also create [private workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/working-with-your-team/collaborating-in-team-workspaces/). A private workspace is a team workspace that's only visible to the user who created it and team members who have been invited to join it.

If you're setting up an [Enterprise team](https://www.postman.com/pricing/), you can also [manage which users can create team workspaces](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-workspaces/).

## Manage product access

You can [manage access](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/manage-team-product-access/) to add-on products and Enterprise solutions that you've purchased for your team. This enables you to provide additional permissions and features to team members as needed.

## Configure team settings

You can manage a variety of settings in your [team settings dashboard](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#access-team-settings). From the dashboard, you can configure items such as your team's [profile](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#manage-your-team-profile), [discoverability](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#make-your-team-discoverable), [custom domains](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#adding-custom-domains), and [authentication methods](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/team-settings/#edit-authentication-methods).

## Secure your Postman team

Depending on your [plan](https://www.postman.com/pricing), you can secure your team's data and user accounts by using the following:

* [Postman API key management](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-api-keys/)
* [Secret Scanner](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/)
* [Audit logs](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/audit-logs/)
* [SSO](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/)
* [SCIM](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/)
* [Domain verification and capture](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/)
