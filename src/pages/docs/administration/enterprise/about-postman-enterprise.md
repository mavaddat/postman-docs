Postman Enterprise plans are for organizations that need advanced identity management, security, and governance features as they design, build, test, and deploy APIs. Postman Enterprise enables you to deploy Postman at scale, manage your team, and streamline your organization's API development process.

## Enterprise features

Postman Enterprise has features for reporting, advanced identity management, the Private API Network, API governance and API security, collaboration, and administration.

### Reports

Postman Enterprise enables you to access reports that give you insights into the state of your APIs, including API creation, collection execution, and test runs. Reports also have information about your team's API consumption, performance, security posture, and SLA adherence. To learn more about reports, see [Using reports](/docs/reports/reports-overview/).

### Advanced identity management

Postman Enterprise plans give you access to advanced identity management features, including:

* **Role-based access control (RBAC)** - Postman Enterprise RBAC enables you to give the right team members access to the right tools and data. To learn more about the team-level roles available to Enterprise teams, including Super Admin, Community Manager, and API Network Manager, see [Defining roles](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles).
* **User groups** - An Enterprise plan enables you to organize team members into groups, then assign roles and permissions according to each group's function. To learn more about user groups, see [User groups](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/user-groups/).
* **Single sign-on (SSO)** - You can enable team members to sign in to Postman Enterprise using your organization's [identity provider (IdP)](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/#identity-providers-supported). To learn more about setting up SSO for your team, see [Intro to SSO](/docs/administration/sso/intro-sso/).
* **System for cross-domain identity management (SCIM)** - Setting up SCIM enables you to automatically provision and de-provision team members and organize them into [user groups](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/user-groups/). To learn more about enabling SCIM for your team, see [SCIM provisioning](/docs/administration/scim-provisioning/scim-provisioning-overview/).
* **Domain capture** - Domain capture enables you to consolidate all your organization's users into a single Postman team and ensure that any new users who sign up for Postman with your domain are automatically added. To learn more about setting up domain capture, see [Configure domain verification and account capture in Postman](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/).

### The Private API Network

The Private API Network provides a [central directory](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-catalog/) of workspaces, collections, and APIs your team uses internally. Your Postman team can access these resources and start using them right away. By using the Private API Network, you can enable developers across your organization to discover, consume, and track API development in one place.

### API Governance and API Security features

Postman Enterprise plans provide you with advanced [API governance](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-governance/) and [API security](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/api-security/) features:

* **Secret Scanner** - Create [custom patterns](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/secret-scanner/#custom-patterns) to proactively check for secret leaks.
* **Public link governance** - View and manage elements like workspaces, documentation, and collection links that your team [makes public](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/manage-public-elements/).
* **Audit logs** - Use [audit logs](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/audit-logs/) to understand how your team members are using Postman.
* **Configurable API governance and API security warnings** - Custom API governance and API security warnings enable you to apply standards consistently throughout your API development process's [design](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/api-definition-warnings/) and [testing](/docs/api-governance/api-testing/api-testing-warnings/) phases. You can also use the [Postman CLI](/docs/postman-cli/postman-cli-overview/) to return Postman API Governance and API Security warnings.
* **Static IP monitoring** - Use collection-based monitors to monitor APIs that are behind a restricted firewall. To learn more about static IP monitoring, see [Running monitors using static IPs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/using-static-IPs-to-monitor/).

### Collaboration

Postman Enterprise plans enable your organization to collaborate internally and with partners:

* **The Private API Network** - Team members with the Enterprise-only API Network Manager role can approve which APIs to add to your Private API Network. For more information, see [Your Private API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/private-api-network/adding-private-network/).
* **Partner Workspaces** - Your organization can invite partners to a shared workspace to collaborate and build products and services with your APIs. To learn more about Partner Workspaces, see [Partner Workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/partner-workspaces/).
* **Advanced version control** - Manage permissions for reviewers and assign merge checks for forks on Postman elements. For more details, see [Pull request settings](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/creating-pull-requests/#pull-request-settings).

### Administration

After you purchase a Postman Enterprise plan, you can customize it to meet your organization's needs:

* **Postman Enterprise app** - The [Postman Enterprise app](/docs/administration/enterprise/managing-enterprise-deployment/) is a version of the Postman desktop app that offers greater control to administrators. After you purchase a Postman Enterprise plan, you can use the Enterprise app to manage deployment and installations within your organization.
* **App versioning** - Set a team-wide version of the Postman desktop app for your organization. To learn more about app versioning, see [Managing Postman app versioning](/docs/administration/enterprise/managing-enterprise-deployment/#managing-postman-app-versioning).
* **Enterprise integrations** - Some integrations, including [Azure DevOps](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/azure-devops/), [GitHub Enterprise Server](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/github/), and [GitLab Self-Managed](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/gitlab/), are only available with an Enterprise plan.
