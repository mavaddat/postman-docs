> **[Domain capture is available on Postman Enterprise Ultimate plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)**

As a [Team Admin](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles), you can enable domain capture after you've completed its [prerequisites](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/domain-capture-overview/#prerequisites-for-domain-capture), including [adding and verifying a domain](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/add-and-verify-a-domain/). Domain capture will move all of the existing users who are associated with your verified domain or subdomain to your Enterprise team. Moving forward, any Postman users who sign up for a new account with the relevant domain will be automatically added to your team.

Your team must have only SAML-based SSO authentication methods enabled to turn on domain capture. Alternative authentication methods, such as Postman or Google sign in, must be [turned off](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/#editing-sso-settings).

To enable domain capture, navigate to the [domain dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/domain-capture) and [create a request to claim accounts](#claim-verified-accounts) associated with the verified domain. When the request is approved, Team Admins can work with Postman support to [manage accounts associated with the verified domain](#contact-support-to-manage-accounts).

## View unclaimed accounts

Team Admins can view unclaimed accounts in the [domain dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/domain-capture). Unclaimed accounts are accounts associated with a verified domain and aren't yet part of your team. You can view unclaimed accounts before enabling domain capture. When you're ready to enable domain capture, [create a request to claim verified accounts](#claim-verified-accounts).

1. Open Postman and select **Team > Team Settings** in the Postman header. Select **Authentication** in the left sidebar, then select the **Domains** tab.
1. Select **Manage** next to the domain with the **VERIFIED** status you want to view unclaimed accounts for, and then select **View Accounts**.

    > Optionally, you can select the number of unclaimed accounts next to the domain in the domain dashboard.

1. View the list of accounts not part of your team.

1. Optionally, you can select **Export CSV** to export the list as a CSV file. You will receive an email containing the download link.

## Claim verified accounts

Team Admins can create a request with Postman support to claim verified accounts associated with a [verified domain](/docs/administration/domain-verification-and-capture/add-and-verify-a-domain/). Domain capture is enabled once the request is approved. Then you can work with Postman support to [manage unclaimed accounts](#contact-support-to-manage-accounts). Before you enable domain capture, you can [view unclaimed accounts](#view-unclaimed-accounts).

> To turn off domain capture, you must [contact Postman support](#contact-support-to-manage-accounts).

### Contact support to manage accounts

1. Open Postman and select **Team > Team Settings** in the Postman header. Select **Authentication** in the left sidebar, then select the **Domains** tab.

### User experience

When domain capture is enabled, new Postman users who sign up for Postman with email addresses associated with your domain or subdomain are automatically added to your team.

Existing Postman users with email addresses associated with the domain or subdomain will only be able to access Postman after joining your team. This applies to existing users who are part of other teams and existing individual users. The next time existing users sign in to Postman, they will get a notification that your team manages their account. Existing users can join the team using this notification.

> You won't be able to selectively pick users you'd like to add to your team. Once enabled, the number of unclaimed accounts will reduce as these users sign in and join your team.

Existing users who were on other Postman teams will lose access to all data from their earlier teams, including personal workspaces. No data will be transferred from their earlier teams to their new team. Users won't be able to remain on or join extra Postman teams with their captured accounts.

> To transfer an existing user's collections and environments from their earlier teams to their new team, [contact Postman support](#contact-support-to-manage-accounts).
